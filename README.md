# Revision Strike

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stevegrunwell/revision-strike.png)](https://travis-ci.org/stevegrunwell/revision-strike)

Unless post revisions are explicitly limited, WordPress will build up a hefty sum of revisions over time. While it's great to have revision history for some recent content, the chances that old revisions will be necessary diminish the longer a post has been published. Revision Strike is designed to automatically remove these unneeded revisions on older, published posts.


## How does it work?

First, a threshold is set, with a default of 30 days. Once a day, Revision Strike will run and find any post revisions in the database attached to **published** posts with a post date of at least 30 (or your custom threshold) days ago, and "strike" (tear-down and remove) them from the WordPress database.
